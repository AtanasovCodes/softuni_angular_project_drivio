The idea of the app is to provide a platform for user to rent vehicles. Users can rent a vehicle for a specific period of time, and the app will handle the booking. For the moment there is no payment integration, but it can be added in the future.

## Features

- User registration and login
- Vehicle listing with details
- Booking system for vehicles
- User profile management
- Responsive design
